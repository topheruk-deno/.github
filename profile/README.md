# Welcome to all things... Deno 👨🏿‍💻👋🏿

This
[Organisation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations)
has been setup as a way for me to both keep all material related to related
material in one place but also have greater exposure to GitHub features.

Once you have had a look through this profile, you can head to my
[main profile](https://github.com/topheruk) where I have details on various
repositories, organisations & gists

### Building Web Applications using [fresh🍋](https://fresh.deno.dev/)

Creating a new project is as easy as:
`$ deno run -A -r https://fresh.deno.dev [<dir_name>]`

### Using [tailwind🌬️](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)

Styling with tailwind seems to be the current trend with React projects. Should
hopefully be getting better at learning the docs
